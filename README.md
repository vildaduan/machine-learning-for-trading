## Machine Learning for Trading – Market Simulator



This project is part of a larger system that incrementally builds an AI-based trading platform using machine learning and algorithmic trading techniques. Each component contributes to a unified trading system designed to simulate real-world decision-making and portfolio management.



In this phase, the focus is on developing a \*\*market simulator\*\* that processes trading orders, tracks portfolio value over time, and evaluates portfolio performance. This simulator serves as a foundational component for more advanced trading strategies and models implemented in later stages of the system.

\## Project Overview



The market simulator:

\- Accepts a sequence of trading orders

\- Simulates trades over historical market data

\- Tracks portfolio holdings and cash balance

\- Calculates portfolio value over time

\- Evaluates overall performance



This implementation emphasizes correctness, extensibility, and realistic modeling of trading behavior.

\## Objectives



\- \*\*Market Simulation\*\*  

&nbsp; Design and implement a market simulator capable of handling trading orders and portfolio updates.



\- \*\*Transaction Costs\*\*  

&nbsp; Model real-world trading costs and understand their impact on portfolio performance.

\## Future Extensions



This simulator is designed to integrate seamlessly with future components such as:

\- Strategy learners

\- Machine learning–based trading agents

\- Performance analytics and optimization tools
